# sign-up-form
- First project using about form inputs, generated content w/ ::before & ::after, custom fonts, background images, relative/absolute positioning, CSS variables, box shadows, and opacity.

#### Learning outcomes
- I really enjoyed doing the invalid password messages with generated content. I think it's neat!
- Working with inputs is quite straightforward in my opinion (so far)
- Learning how to use .gitignore. it is very straightforward and useful to use for notes / random data.
- Practiced using display: block (default) to position elements instead of relying on turning everything into a flex item (like in my previous projects)
  - I think I gained a better understanding on when not to use flexbox! If I only need two items above each other, don't need flex!
- Background images are surprisingly difficult to configure. I would like to better understand them for my next project.
